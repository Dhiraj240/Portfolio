An opensource contributor who learns new skills everyday.I am final year undergraduate student from Electronics & Telecommunication branch.
I have done several internships and taken part in various hackathons.
I was Google Summer of Code 2019 Mentor and Google Code In 2018 Mentor, worked as a student developer in Summer of Code In Space program 2019 among 16 selected developers around the globe.

I have keen interest in Technology and loves to explore more by learning new things apart from normal college curriculum.
I do help people who comes under my area of interest and makes me realize my shortcomings.

I want to be a part of organisation which challenges me to get out from my comfort area. Please have a look on my Github, Gitlab and drop me message at ```dhiraj.8.sharma@gmail.com``` if you have any open position for me.
