1. Made clusters of sentence with same percentage similarity using NLP and
increasing the software speed through the use of parallel computing.

2. First the document is cleaned using scrubbing which includes removing noise,
lemmatization, removing numbers and then comparing the resulting sentence using
spacy module.

3. The speed of comparison is increased using distributed systems using pyspark
which uses master slave configuration where data.
