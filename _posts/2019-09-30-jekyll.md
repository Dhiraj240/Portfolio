## European Space Agency
 
 The program started with the reading of **JPIP** Server and kickstarted the work to build an optimized docker container for the project.
 
 Check the [sphinx documentation](https://dhiraj240.github.io/SOCIS-2019/) about how to build Docker file using script.
 
 Here is my [container on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/dhiraj240/dockeresa).
 
 The opensource code can be [checked here](https://github.com/Dhiraj240/dockeresa).
