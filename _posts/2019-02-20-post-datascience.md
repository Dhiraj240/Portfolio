2. Worked on preprocessing and exploratory data analysis of Alzheimerâ€™s disease
MRI (OASIS) data and predicting results using Machine Learning models.

3. Split the data in Train/Valid/Testing and used Feature Engineering concepts.

4. Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random forest and Decision tree
models were used to test accuracy as which classifier is useful in timely prediction
of Alzheimer disease. 

5. Featured on his [official medium blog](https://medium.com/beatbluewhalechallenge/iot-to-help-patients-with-alzheimers-and-dementia-c72385f9b286).
